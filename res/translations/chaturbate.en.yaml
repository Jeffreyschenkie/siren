    <b>I've subscribed to a model but I don't receive notifications</b>

    We use the same list of online models as affiliate sites use for advertisements.
    Some models decided to not appear there so we cannot know when they are online.
    You can tell a model about this bot and a model may probably change her or his mind on this setting.
    The setting is <b>My Profile</b> → <b>Settings &amp; Privacy</b> → <b>Appear on network sites</b> → <b>Yes</b>
faq_direct_subscriptions:

    <b>It would be nice if I can subscribe to models directly from their profile pages</b>

    Actually models can provide a link in their profile pages and a floating icon exacly for this purpose.
    You can tell a model about this feature.
    A model can write to siren.chat@gmail.com and we will create a floating icon for her or him for free.
