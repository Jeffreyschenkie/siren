    <b>I've subscribed to a model but I don't receive notifications</b>

    Some models banned some countries from viewing them.
    We get a list of online models visible from Netherlands or USA.
    If both countries are banned we are unable to determine if the model is online.

    <b>It would be nice if I can subscribe to models directly from their profile pages</b>

    Actually models can provide a link in their profile pages exacly for this purpose.
    You can tell a model about this feature.
    A model can write to siren.telegram@gmail.com and we will help her to do it.
